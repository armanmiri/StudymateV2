StudymateV2 is the second iteration of the Studymate project, aimed at building a collaborative study platform that enhances the way students learn together. This version focuses on improving the architecture, planning, and scalability of the original concept.

## 📚 Overview

StudymateV2 is envisioned as a study companion tool where users can:

- Collaborate on notes and resources
